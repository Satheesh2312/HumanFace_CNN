Face detection:

The first step is detecting faces present in the input provided. This input could be in the form of images or videos. Also, the system may be required to detect one or more faces. Face detection comes under the category of object detection. 
The system identifies an object as the face and demarcates it, that is, localizes its extent with a box

Convolutional neural networks:

It is a set of deep feed-forward artificial neural networks to analyze visual images. CNN can take into account the 2D topology of an image and minimizes the effect of scale changes, turns and angles, biases, and other distortions in the input image. It is used in:

Supervised learning for object classification, recognition and detection
Unsupervised learning for image segmentation
Image Compressio
